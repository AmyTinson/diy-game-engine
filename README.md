# ðŸš§ A Game Made with My Own Engine - Work in Progress ðŸš§

The goal of this project is to build a game in React, while creating a self-made, reusable game engine, in order to sharpen my skills managing complex application state.

There are plenty of libraries and applications out there that help do some legwork for you - Godot, Unity, GameMaker, as well as react-game-engine, to name a few...  While I can (quickly) get something up and running leveraging those, I wanted a solid project to come back to and learn from at all times.  Something that drives me to constantly question and optimize in hopes that maybe it can be useful (or at least fun to play) one day.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  While it's great to use to get started quickly, I do recommend trying to build things out without leveraging create-react-app as well.  You learn more about what happens behind the scenes, which is pretty neat.

The starry background leverages CSS from [Sylvian Garnot](https://codepen.io/sylvaingarnot).  Definitely check him out!
